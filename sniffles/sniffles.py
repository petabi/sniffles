"""Sniffles.py
   Traffic generator for IDS evaluation.  Please see the usage section
   for a description of all the available options in Sniffles.
   For detailed information please see the README file.
   Running Sniffles without any arguments will generate a
   single, completely random packet.  The various options can be
   used to modify how packets are generated.  Note, Sniffles can build
   packets based on rules. Running Sniffles with rules will still
   generate traffic even if the rules are incorrect or contain
   features not implemented by Sniffles.  Of course, the resultant
   traffic may not be what is intended.
   It is a good idea to confirm that the data generated is what is
   expected.
   Another note about rulesets: only enabled rules are considered.
   Any rule that is commented out in the ruleset will be ignored.
   Commentted rules are preceded by a # symbol.

   Note, designating the length only determines the content length.
   Headers will be added in addition to the designated size.

   Packets are written into a pcap file.
